# Dominos Sales Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

## Project Overview
Dominos aims to optimize ingredient ordering by **predicting future sales** and creating efficient purchase orders. By leveraging historical sales data and predictive modeling, 
this project ensures the right amount of ingredients are in stock—**minimizing waste and preventing stockouts**.

## Business Use Cases
- **Inventory Management**: Maintain optimal stock levels to meet future demand.
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimize waste and excess inventory costs.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Accurately predict sales trends for strategic planning.
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Streamline ordering processes to prevent disruptions.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Exploration
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify sales trends, seasonality, and patterns.

### 2. Sales Prediction
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract important features like promotional periods and holiday effects.
- **Model Selection**: Implement **ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM**, or Regression models.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Use **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** for performance analysis.

### 3. Purchase Order Generation
- **Sales Forecasting**: Predict pizza sales for the upcoming period.
- **Ingredient Calculation**: Compute required ingredient quantities based on sales forecasts.
- **Purchase Order Creation**: Generate an optimized purchase order.

## Results
✅ **Accurate Sales Predictions**  
✅ **Comprehensive Purchase Order for Future Demand**  

## Technologies & Tools
- **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas  
- **Modeling**: Scikit-learn, Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA/SARIMA/Prophet/LSTM)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
